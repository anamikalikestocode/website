                I wish I was more eloquent.<br><br>

                That's a weird thing to admit. Vulnerable, actually. But it's something I've been thinking about for a large part of my life, so here we are.<br><br>

                And no, I don't mean I wish I had better vocabulary or sounded fancier. That's not what eloquence is. So what is it then?<br><br>

                At first, I defined it as the distance between what you think and what you manage to say. The smaller that gap, the more eloquent you are. Some people talk and you can tell there's no loss in transmission. The rest of us are always walking away from conversations thinking <em>that's not quite what I meant</em>.<br><br>

                But it's not just about being articulate.<br><br>

                My ex-boyfriend once called me eloquent. It was one of the best compliments I had ever received. I felt far too good about this compliment and I've thought a lot about why.<br><br>

                It's because being called eloquent is being called thoughtful. Reflective. Considered. It's a compliment about the quality of your thinking.<br><br>

                That made me realize: eloquence isn't primarily about expression at all. Not at its root. It's about what comes before expression. There's the thought (the quality and depth of it) and then there's the articulation of that thought. And the former matters way more than the latter. You can be the smoothest talker in the room, but if there's nothing underneath, nobody's calling you eloquent. They're calling you slick.<br><br>

                So at the root of eloquence, there's thinking.<br><br>

                Fine. But what's at the root of thinking?<br><br>

                Here's where I got uncomfortable.<br><br>

                Because my honest answer? Education.<br><br>

                Sure, degrees are part of it. But I mean being well-read. Widely exposed. Deep in ideas. The more I read or spoke to people who knew more, the more I learned, the more angles I had on any given question. I can take something like humanitarian intervention and turn it over 10 ways instead of 3. That's not just expression; it's genuinely more rigorous thinking. My inputs shape my thinking. I can't think beyond what I've been exposed to.<br><br>

                So the chain started to look like this:<br>
                Education → Thinking → Expression → Eloquence<br><br>

                I believed it. It made sense to me.<br><br>

                But then I noticed what it implied.<br><br>

                More Education → Deeper Thinking → More Eloquence<br>
                ∴ Less Education → Shallower Thinking → Less Eloquence?<br><br>

                If education leads to deeper thinking, and deeper thinking leads to eloquence... then what about people with less education than me?<br><br>

                Do they think less?<br><br>

                I couldn't accept that. Thinking is the most fundamental thing about being human. I refuse to believe that someone without education thinks less than I do.<br><br>

                And yet.<br><br>

                Here's the part I really didn't want to look at.<br><br>

                When I imagine someone more educated than me (i.e. someone who's read more, been exposed to more) I kind of do assume they think more expansively. I give them that credit automatically.<br><br>

                But when I try to apply the same logic in the other direction? When I try to say someone less educated might think less?<br><br>

                I resist. It feels elitist. Almost monstrous.<br><br>

                So what's going on? Why can I accept the hierarchy above me but not below me?<br><br>

                My first instinct was to find a way out that made everyone equal.<br><br>

                I thought of a hypothetical farmer. This man who has worked his land for forty years thinks about soil and weather in ways I can't perceive. The farmer has something real: tacit knowledge, pattern recognition, familiarity with his specific land.<br><br>

                Comforting. But I don't think it's true.<br><br>

                Because an agronomist who's studied soil science probably does understand soil better than someone who's only worked one plot. The agronomist knows why things work, not just that they work. They have access to centuries of accumulated knowledge, controlled experiments, the ability to generalize across contexts.<br><br>

                The hypothetical farmer does not have the same depth of thinking. He just has local expertise.<br><br>

                So is the uncomfortable answer just...true? Education makes you think deeper. That's it?<br><br>

                I sat with that. And something still felt off.<br><br>

                The sentence "education makes you think deeper" felt true and incomplete at the same time. Like it was describing something accurately while missing something else entirely.<br><br>

                And then I thought about it differently.<br><br>

                The agronomist thinks deeper about soil than the farmer. Fine. But what about everything else the farmer knows?<br><br>

                Not about soil science. About what it means to depend on something you can't control. About patience measured in seasons, not days. About building something slowly over decades. About getting up every morning and doing the same work without guarantee of outcome. About a relationship to labor that isn't abstract but physical, daily, lived.<br><br>

                Can you learn that from a book?<br><br>

                I don't think so.<br><br>

                And this is when I realized I'd been treating "depth" like it was one thing. It's not.<br><br>

                There's depth that comes from study; from reading, from frameworks, from exposure to how other people have thought about hard problems. Call it intellectual depth. And yes, education builds this. You can't think rigorously about political theory or computer-human interaction without doing the reading. That's just true.<br><br>

                But there's another kind of depth. One that comes from experience. From living through something rather than reading about it. From time spent in conditions that teach you things no book contains.<br><br>

                Education → Intellectual Depth<br>
                Experience → Lived Depth<br><br>

                The farmer might not be deeper than the agronomist about soil science. But he might be deeper about endurance. About dependence. About what it means to commit to something for a lifetime.<br><br>

                And suddenly the hierarchy I was worried about (i.e. educated people on top, less educated below) started to dissolve. Not because I was being charitable. But because I was finally seeing that depth isn't singular.<br><br>

                Think about it this way.<br><br>

                A philosophy professor can think more rigorously about the concept of grief than most people. They've read the literature, considered the frameworks, examined it from every angle.<br><br>

                But are they more eloquent about grief than a parent who lost their child 20 years ago and has carried it every day since?<br><br>

                I don't think so. There's something in the latter that no amount of reading produces. A weight. A knowledge that isn't intellectual but lived.<br><br>

                Education gives you depth about ideas. Living gives you depth about life.<br><br>

                They're different. And you can't substitute one for the other.<br><br>

                So what does this mean for wanting to be eloquent?<br><br>

                It means my original chain is true, but only for a certain kind of eloquence:<br><br>

                Education → Intellectual Depth → Eloquence about Ideas<br>
                Experience → Lived Depth → Eloquence about Life<br><br>

                If I want to think and speak more rigorously about ideas, I need to read more, learn more, expose myself to harder arguments. There's no shortcut.<br><br>

                But it also means there's a whole other kind of eloquence I can't access through books. The kind that comes from having lived something. And I find myself appreciating that so much more now. When I hear someone speak about loss or resilience or commitment, with the weight of actual experience, there's an eloquence there that nobody's reading can touch.<br><br>

                In all honesty, when my ex-boyfriend called me eloquent, it was probably because I didn't say "like" every five words the way he did. Low bar. But hey – it got me this far.<br><br>

                So here's where I've finally landed.<br><br>

                I want to be more eloquent. I'm not going to pretend I've moved past that. And now I understand what it actually requires.<br><br>

                For the intellectual kind, more reading, more learning, more exposure to difficult ideas.<br><br>

                For the lived kind, it will be found in experiences I haven't had yet. Things I'll live through that will give me access to depth I can't currently imagine. And I find myself almost looking forward to that; not the suffering itself, but the understanding that might come with it. The eloquence earned by living, not just thinking.<br><br>

                Education gives you one kind of depth. Life gives you another.<br><br>

                Maybe the point was never to be eloquent. It was to become the kind of person who has something worth saying. And that takes a life, not just a library.
